# Art
ActiveRecord Translated

art was created to translate ActiveRecord models with the minimum footprint
possible.

* Built on public AR and i18n features (NO monkey patches), so easy to upgrade.
* Super simple, easy to grok, hard to break.

It consists of basically a few macros and a wee bit of metaprogramming.
Translations are stored in a single table.  These are lazy-looked up and cached
in memory, so both simple and wicked-fast.
